Phase 1/Session 3



Agenda:

Session 3 will be all about how to use deep learning for computer vision using convolutional neural networks. These are the state of the art when it comes to image classification, image detection, image localization and what not. and they beat vanilla deep networks at image related tasks. Because convolution is such a central part of this type of neural network, we are going to go in-depth on this topic. After describing the architecture of a convolutional neural network, we will go through other essential pieces that go along in training any CNN network. Post that we will jump straight into code, and we will show you how to extend the deep neural networks we built last time (in Session 1 and 2) with just a few new functions to turn them into CNNs. We will then test their performance and show how convolutional neural networks written in both Pytorch and Keras can outperform the accuracy of a plain neural network
