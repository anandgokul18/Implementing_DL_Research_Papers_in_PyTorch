    "# Why CNN and not Regular Neural Nets\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Regular Neural Nets donâ€™t scale well to full images**\n",
    "\n",
    "In MNIST dataset,images are only of size 28x28x1 (28 wide, 28 high, 1 color channels), so a single fully-connected neuron in a first hidden layer of a regular Neural Network would have 28x28x1 = 786 weights. This amount still seems manageable,\n",
    "\n",
    "**But what if we move to larger images.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an image of more respectable size, e.g. 200x200x3, would lead to neurons that have 200x200x3 = 120,000 weights. Moreover, we would almost certainly want to have several such neurons, so the parameters would add up quickly! Clearly, this full connectivity is wasteful and the huge number of parameters would quickly lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.Parameter Sharing**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "A feature detector that is useful in one part of the image is probably useful in another part of the image.Thus CNN are good in capturing translation invariance. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sparsity of connections**\n",
    "In each layer,each output value depends only on a small number of inputs.This makes CNN networks easy to train on smaller training datasets and is less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.3D volumes of neurons.**\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks take advantage of the fact that the input consists of images and they constrain the architecture in a more sensible way. In particular, unlike a regular Neural Network, the layers of a ConvNet have neurons arranged in 3 dimensions: width, height, depth.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In purely mathematical terms, convolution is a function derived from two given functions by integration which expresses how the shape of one is modified by the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "However we are interested in understanding the the actual convolution operation in the context of neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**An intuitive understanding of Convolution**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Convolution is an operation done  to extract features from the images as these features will be used by the network to learn about a particular image.In the case of a dog image,the feature could be the shape of a nose or the shape of an eye which will help the network later to identify an image as a dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution operation is performed with the help of the following three elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.Input Image-** The image to convolve on\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.Feature Detector/Kernel/Filter-** They are the bunch of numbers in a matrix form intended to extract features from an image.They can be 1dimensional ,2-dimensional or 3-dimensional\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.Feature Map/Activation Map-** The resultant of the convolution operation performed between image and feature detector gives a Feature Map.\n",

    "\n",
