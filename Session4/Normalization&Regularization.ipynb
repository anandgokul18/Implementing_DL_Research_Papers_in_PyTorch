    "# Regularization\n",
    " A central problem in machine learning is how to make an algorithm that will perform well not just on the training data, but also on new inputs. Many strategies used in machine learning are explicitly designed to reduce the test error, possibly at the expense of increased training error. These strategies are known collectively as regularization.\n",

Put another way, regularization can be viewed as a way of compromising between finding small weights and minimizing the original cost function. The relative importance of the two elements of the compromise depends on the value of λ: when λ is small we prefer to minimize the original cost function, but when λ is large we prefer small weights.\n",

Over time this can lead to the weight vector being very large indeed. This can cause the weight vector to get stuck pointing in more or less the same direction, since changes due to gradient descent only make tiny changes to the direction, when the length is long. I believe this phenomenon is making it hard for our learning algorithm to properly explore the weight space, and consequently harder to find good minima of the cost function.\n",

    "#### Comparing L1 and L2 \n",
    "In both expressions the effect of regularization is to shrink the weights. This accords with our intuition that both kinds of regularization penalize large weights. But the way the weights shrink is different. In L1 regularization, the weights shrink by a constant amount toward 0. In L2 regularization, the weights shrink by an amount which is proportional to w. And so when a particular weight has a large magnitude, |w|, L1 regularization shrinks the weight much less than L2 regularization does. By contrast, when |w| is small, L1 regularization shrinks the weight much more than L2 regularization. The net result is that L1 regularization tends to concentrate the weight of the network in a relatively small number of high-importance connections, while the other weights are driven toward zero."

    "## Dropout \n",

    "So it takes a probability p and based on the value of p it randomly disables that percentage of neuron.\n",

    "So why does dropout increases the robustness of the model?\n",
    "Heuristically, when we dropout different sets of neurons, it's rather like we're training different neural networks. And so the dropout procedure is like averaging the effects of a very large number of different networks. The different networks will overfit in different ways, and so, hopefully, the net effect of dropout will be to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example In cnn if the model is trained on dogs vs cats example and few particular neurons having higher weight, everytime the model witnesses the whiskers in the image it activates those neurons and we get cat. But what if those whiskers are no there then model fails significantly. so dropout forces the model to learn more attributes of the training data while training. \n",
    "\n",
    "when p = 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "By repeating dropout over and over, our network will learn a set of weights and biases. Of course, those weights and biases will have been learnt under conditions in which half the hidden neurons were dropped out. When we actually run the full network that means that twice as many hidden neurons will be active. To compensate for that, we halve the weights outgoing from the hidden neurons."

    "## Label Smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "When we apply the cross-entropy loss to a classification task, we're expecting true labels to have 1, while the others 0. In other words, we have no doubts that the true labels are true, and the others are not. Is that always true? Maybe not. Many manual annotations are the results of multiple participants. They might have different criteria. They might make some mistakes. They are human, after all. As a result, the ground truth labels we have had perfect beliefs on are possible wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact of this on model is \n",
    "First, it may result in over-fitting:  if the  model  learns  to  assign  full  probability  to  the  ground truth label for each training example, it is not guaranteed to generalize.  Second, it encourages the differences between the largest  logit  and  all  others  to  become  large,  and  this, combined with the bounded gradient reduces the ability of the model to adapt.  Intuitively, this happens because the model becomes too confident about its predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "One possibile solution to this is to relax our confidence on the labels. For instance, we can slighly lower the loss target values from 1 to, say, 0.9. And naturally we increase the target value of 0 for the others slightly as such. This idea is called label smoothing.\n",

    "#### why batch norm ?\n",
    "Batch normalization reduces the amount by what the hidden unit values shift around (covariance shift). To explain covariance shift, let’s have a deep network on cat detection. We train our data on only black cats’ images. So, if we now try to apply this network to data with colored cats, it is obvious; we’re not going to do well. The training set and the prediction set are both cats’ images but they differ a little bit. In other words, if an algorithm learned some X to Y mapping, and if the distribution of X changes, then we might need to retrain the learning algorithm by trying to align the distribution of X with the distribution of Y. ( Deeplearning.ai: Why Does Batch Norm Work? (C2W3L06))\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, batch normalization allows each layer of a network to learn by itself a little bit more independently of other layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use higher learning rates because batch normalization makes sure that there’s no activation that’s gone really high or really low. And by that, things that previously couldn’t get to train, it will start to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "It reduces overfitting because it has a slight regularization effects. Similar to dropout, it adds some noise to each hidden layer’s activations. Therefore, if we use batch normalization, we will use less dropout, which is a good thing because we are not going to lose a lot of information. However, we should not depend only on batch normalization for regularization; we should better use it together with dropout.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it works?\n",
    "So we use batch norm as layer before the activation layer which normalizies the data by subtracting the batch data with batch mean and then dividing by batch standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "After normalizing the layer the weights are shifted/scaled by some value for the next layer now what if the model wants to undo the normalization operation to decrease the loss, model should have some control of that, therefore we introduce two more learnable parameters gamma and beta.\n",
